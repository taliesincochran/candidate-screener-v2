# Candidate-Screener
This app uses the IBM Watson Api for speech to text and personality analysis.  The candidate signs up and logs in and is asked a series of questions. The app records the answers, sends that through the two apis to get a analysis of the candidates personality.  The candidate can then compare themselves to other historic or popular figures through charts and graphs.
